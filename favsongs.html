    <h2> <a href="https://youtu.be/u9raS7-NisU"> Daylight </a> </h2>
    <p> Taylor Swift talks about going through difficult relationships and beginning to doubt her capacity to find genuine love in the album's closing track, "Lover." But then she meets someone who gives her life a new sense of hope. Although she mentions having had bad luck in the dating department in the past, when she finds her new partner, she only wants to think about them and their happiness as a couple. </p>

    <h2> <a href="https://youtu.be/K-a8s8OLBSE"> Cardigan </a> </h2>
    <p> According to Taylor Swift, "cardigan" is the first chapter of the "Teenage Love Triangle," which is narrated from Betty's perspective. The next two songs, "august" and "betty," portray a love triangle from all three people's points of view at various points in their lives. </p>

    <h2> <a href="https://youtu.be/7lLigiVgJsE"> Fearless (Taylor's Version) </a> </h2>
    <p> The first of Taylor Swift's rerecorded albums, Fearless (Taylor's Version), was released in an effort to reclaim ownership of the six albums she recorded under Big Machine Records. Every song from Fearless Platinum Edition appears in this album in a new structure, along with the stand-alone single "Today Was a Fairytale" and six tracks she dropped from the original Fearless album from 2008. Swift revealed her re-recording of "Love Story"—which was released that night at midnight—and Fearless on the morning show Good Morning America on February 11, 2021. </p>

    <h2> <a href="https://youtu.be/7Gbg6Z70J7E"> You're On Your Own, Kid </a> </h2>
    <p> "You're On Your Own, Kid" from the album Midnights tells the story of a young person who longs for love but eventually realizes that they are on their own. As she matures during the song, the music intensifies and the verses transport you back to her early years. The audience gets a look into Taylor's background as the song intensifies: after writing a song, she burns the lyrics or letters into ashes. She finds herself suddenly on her own and learning how to be herself. Lyrically and vocally, it has a deeper shine than Red, but otherwise sounds similar. The song is similar to Lover's "It's Nice To Have a Friend," which also features a love story between students. Both songs include brief rhyming couplets that are comparable in length. </p>

    <h2> <a href="https://youtu.be/66TQBtlRKc4"> Style </a> </h2>
    <p> 1989 Album song entitled "Style" describes a troubled romance between two people who constantly returning to each other. Swift seems to have gained inspiration from her relationship with Harry Styles and has even made musical references to his band. </p>

    <h2> <a href="https://youtu.be/FhPLQVlUiNQ"> Getaway Car </a> </h2>
    <p> Taylor's major metaphor for a doomed romance is the scene of criminals running away in a car. She contrasts her second relationship with Tom Hiddleston to a "getaway car" used to flee a criminal scene or her brief romance with Calvin Harris. </p>
